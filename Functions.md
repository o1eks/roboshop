## Functions:

`MyBot()` - Creates a robot. Do not worry too much about what this means, just be sure to have it before your setup.

`begin()` - Turns on the robot. This should be at the top of your setup.

`moveForward(time_in_seconds)` - Moves the robot forward for the specified number of seconds.

`moveBackward(time_in_seconds)` - Moves the robot backward for the specified number of seconds.

`turnLeft(time_in_seconds)` - Turns the robot left for the specified number of seconds.

`turnRight(time_in_seconds)` - Turns the robot right for the specified number of seconds.

`stop()` - Makes the robot stop driving.

`wait(time_in_seconds)` - Makes your robot wait for the amount of time you told it to. Be careful because the robot will not be able to do anything during this time!

`blink()` - Lights up a small blue light on the robot's RedBoard.

`say(message)` - Makes the robot talk to the computer. Great for debugging!
